It is the type of home that inspires froofy descriptions like ""dreamy"", ""cozy"", ""cute"" and ""Portlandesque"". While those are accurate, they are not enough to describe this fantastic home. It is quirky and functional, romantic and well appointed, charming and practical.

Sitting just across the street from the highly popular Alberta Park and within walking distance from several award-winning restaurants, this light-filled bungalow is loaded with character and perfectly mixes original charm with modern updates. Hardwood floors, crown moldings, French-paned windows, custom light fixtures and built-ins all add to the home’s character, while a new roof and Cedar wood deck in the rear yard ensure the home will last the test of time.

The spacious floor plan is flooded with natural light and boasts a living room with a beautiful floor-to-ceiling fireplace. The formal dining room with designer wall covering overlooks the front yard and features a custom built-in bench & coat rack.

The dining room effortlessly flows into the refreshed kitchen, which has been upgraded with stainless steel appliances, white subway tile backsplash and a large walk-in pantry. 

One bedroom offers French door access to the rear yard and the second bedroom has a vaulted ceiling and a closet with custom organizers. The updated bathroom boasts beautiful hex tile floors, pedestal sink, new shower fixtures and subway tiled walls. 

The lower level features a large family room/bonus room with built-in storage,  wood-paneled ceilings & recessed lighting and also has a separate utility area/laundry room with washer & dryer included. 

The private backyard is the perfect place to entertain with its hot tub, raised garden beds and a recently added wooden deck perfect for barbecuing and summer al fresco dining. 

Parking is easy in the long driveway or in the detached garage that can be accessed either through the automatic roll-up door in the front or through the sliding barn door on the side, making it a perfect contender for an ADU, artist’s studio or a She Shed. 

Alberta Park is across the street and offers basketball & tennis courts, dog off-leash area, playground, soccer field, softball field and picnic tables.

With close proximity to New Seasons Market and all the fine dining, shops, bars, cafes & entertainment on Alberta Street and Killingsworth, this location is hard to beat. Enjoy a movie and dinner at McMenamins Kennedy School and free neighborhood access to their soaking pool. Walk down to P’s & Q’s Market for a locally farmed weekend brunch. Watch a show at Alberta Rose Venue and stop at Expatriate on your way home for arguably the best cocktail in town. Or why not spend an evening sitting in the hot tub with a glass of wine while the rain showers you? You can only call that “dreamy”.

Neighborhood Description

This house is right on the edge of the Buckman and Kerns neighborhoods.   Buckman is an eclectic, quirky,  neighborhood Kind of between the Hawthorne District and downtown- a mix of huge gorgeous old Portland homes-All different styles-Old PDX  4 Square, Craftsman, Victorian, Bungalow......some restored and some unrestored!  There are also duplexes, condos,  shops, restaurants, boutiques, cafes -and as you head towards the river, you run into industrial and local businesses.   It is quite a mix!  You can look down almost any street and see downtown and the west hills rising above it.  You are right in the heart of things- In fact just walk across the Burnside Bridge, and you are in the Alphabet District and Pearl,  walk across the Hawthorne Bridge and you are right in the main downtown area!  Head toward the river,  jump on the Esplanade, and head either direction- it will hook you into the Spring Water Trail, or  across one of the bridges into downtown. and Waterfront Park.
 Burnside and the Kerns neighborhood is the official boundary to the north, The Willamette river and Esplanade to the west, SE 28th and Sunnyside Neighborhood to east,  and Hawthorne Blvd and Ladds Addition to the south.   The Hawthorne Belmont area, just to the SE, is one of the most popular and colorful areas of Portland- with Grand Central Bakery, Powells  Book Store being 2 of my favorites!  If you  head just a little to the south along 20th, you will run into Ladds Addition- a neighborhood of angled streets, roundabout rose gardens, charming historic homes of all sizes and tree lined streets.  
If you take Sandy Blvd to the north you are in Hollywood-with it's theaters, shops, restaurants and even a Whole Foods.  So you really are right in the center of things. No matter which way you go, you will hit interesting things.

This beautiful 1927 home is in absolute pristine condition. The exterior is beautifully landscaped and has tons of curb appeal!

Just as you walk up to the front door, to the right there is a cute little sitting area perfect for that morning cup of Joe and taking in the tranquility of the neighborhood. Walking in, you enter the living room, which features a large wood-burning fireplace, beautiful newer double-pane windows that allow TONS of natural light, and beautifully refinished old growth oak hardwood floors. 

To the left of the entry way is the dining area which has been freshly painted a nice neutral color with white trim, and a vintage chandelier in the center. Toward the kitchen is a breakfast nook with large built-in cabinets and marble countertop that really sets it off. 

The gourmet kitchen is recently updated and features a gas range/stove, brand new French door refrigerator, BOSCH dishwasher and lots of counter space. The lighting is fantastic; all recessed and on a dimmer switch allowing for great mood lighting. 

The main floor also features a really great full size bathroom with a pedestal sink, toilet, shower and bathtub! The floor tile is original to the home.

There is a large bedroom on the main floor that features a sliding glass door to the back patio! The backyard has a fantastic wood deck -- with plenty of room for a patio set and grill -- and two raised flower beds which are currently filled with tomatoes, basil and marigolds. Setting it all off is a calming water feature and atmospheric under-tree lighting. 

Just behind the garage and accessible from the back yard is a cool work or creative space that is fully enclosed by windows and a screen door. The ceiling also has a skylight which makes the space super bright and perfect for artistic creativity. 

Upstairs the home features 3 bedrooms, including the master which has two closets and is very large. The smallest of the 3 is a recent addition and features skylights, windows, hardwood floors and a good size closet. The third and most fun bedroom (in my opinion) sits just over the entry to the house. The room itself is a good size but the best part will bring out kid  in you. There is a little nook area perfect for a little kid to play. It has a small window that is just above the entry way, and two little closets for storage. It's a cute, unique little space that's perfect for a kid -- or a kid at heart.

-- Tenants pay all utilities
-- Security deposit equal to one months rent
-- Local schools are: Laurelhurst Elementary, Grant High school, Blossom House, All Saints.

Built in 1925, it wasn't insulated because Philo Farnsworth didn't invent it until 1927.  However, in May of 2015, I had the entire house insulated (including the basement and the attic!) because I bought a brand new 96.6% efficient natural gas furnace.  (I figured it didn't really make sense to buy a fancy new ultra energy efficient furnace if the house leaked hot air like a politician answering reporters' questions :)  Anyway, I also bought a brand new energy efficient refrigerator, microwave range, and toilet (low flow uses only 0.7 gallons of water per flush, and this is good because it lowers your water and sewer bill every month.)  Then I put in brand new windows, because it doesn't make sense to get a fancy new ultra efficient furnace AND insulate the whole place if your windows leak.  Anyway, now everything's brand new and it's super cozy.  I've lived here for almost 9 years now, and it's a terrific place.  Wonderful neighborhood with great schools.  Great neighbors.

Neighborhood Description

We live on a great tree-lined street, just a few blocks off Hawthorne. Close enough to walk it quickly, but just far enough not to struggle with parking! There are tons of fun places to shop and eat out, including coffee shops on Hawthorne and Division (Stumptown, mmmmm!), and we take our son to Laurelhurst and Mt. Tabor playgrounds without getting in the car.

Neighborhood Description

The Share-It Square is just down the block from 8504 SE 8th Ave. Looking to create a community gathering place, several years ago residents turned the intersection into their own public square. Each spring neighbors gather to re-paint the intersection with a vibrant and colorful creative design defining the space as - not simply a passage for autos Ã¢?? but space for pedestrians, bicyclists, lingering, celebrating, and sharing. On each corner of the intersection there are cob-structures: a community bulletin board and chalkboard; a kids' playhouse; a book-sharing shelf; and a 24-hour tea station Ã¢?? a thermos with tea cups and tea; neighbors take turns keeping it supplied with hot water and tea. It is a wonderful focal point and gathering place for neighbors and inspiration for community potlucks and summer parties. 

Walkable to Willamette River, dog park, New Seasons grocery store, Sellwood Park, Sellwood Community Center, Oaks Bottom Refuge, Springwater Corridor Trail, coffee shops, bakery, bars, library, restaurants.

The 4 bedrooms & 5 ½ baths include two master suites for possible multi-generation living; MBR-on-main includes his n' hers master baths (yes, 2!), and the 2nd deluxe MBR contains a sauna.  Seamlessly incorporated are a large Office/Den, huge mirrored exercise room, state of the art wine cellar, and a large bonus area w/fireplace. Double staircases create flexible living spaces. Premium materials echo the natural setting with superb custom cabinetry, extensive stonework, and imported limestone & Brazilian cherry flooring throughout.  A sleek, professional-grade kitchen with a huge pantry overlooks the great room, which includes a very cool built-in bar. All indoor spaces meld easily into the outdoors through extensive deck & patio areas, including a year-round covered outdoor living space with a large built-in outdoor fireplace. 
It's a fast commute from here to both Intel & downtown. But this is the kind of place where you can slow down. Allow yourself to be lulled to sleep by the sounds of nature's symphony, gentle sounds which are broken only by the distant bellow of a ship's horn as it passes down the Willamette.

LOCATION
NW Northrup is central to all of  North West Portland, but being 1 ½ blocks from NW 23rd we are out of the fray, and still walking convenient.  The street car stops 1 ½ blocks away, allowing easy access to the Pearl and downtown without having to drive in the city!  Schools are among the most sought after in the city.   Truly the desirable location in Portland. 

STRUCTURE
The exterior of the house is very Craftsman, but the interior a surprise.  Built in 1910 by William  Knighton, Oregon’s first state architect.  He built the Govenor Hotel immediately before building this house for himself.  It is his signature emblem  on the house.  His beautiful iconoclastic spaces are evident throughout.   Early art-deco, technically Knighton’s “Viennese secessionist.”  (The movement to have all of art integrated.  Klimt was a member of the group also.)  Elegant barrel ceilings.  Wood capped stair walls, not balustrades.   The library with a fireplace is off the living room and is more typical Craftsman, with box beam ceiling. The 3rd floor is also Craftsman, with mission railings and wonderful arched casement windows. Art glass windows, including a wall of in the main stairway.

Except for the kitchen the house has been kept in amazingly original condition. While being updated the kitchen is still in harmony with the rest of the manor.  Mahogony stairs, oak floors throughout the remainder. Stunning lighting.  Plumbing and electrical updates. New  water meter and new lines from the street main.  1 ½ inch pipe.  Great water pressure on all 4 floors. New plumbing and cast iron waste lines for 3rd floor. 

2nd floor has 4 very large bedrooms. 3rd floor would make a wonderful master suite. The smaller bedroom, off of the bath, would be the dressing room/closet. 

There is also charming 700 square foot apartment with a patio in the lower level.  Separately metered. Rents has been renting for $1200 a month. The apartment is not noticeable as entrance is on the north while main entrance is on the east.

Exterior
A large entry porch has a copper roof with glass inserts. Large patios in rear. Native plantings give a hidden forest retreat in the city.

A back yard oasis features a mature grape arbor, apple trees, and secluded area for outdoor entertaining -- unbelievably relaxing and enjoyable on a summer's night.

The infrastructure of the house is completely new – electric, plumbing, heating/cooling. There are Ethernet and cable drops in every room and to the back patio.

The renovation was completely architected by the award-winning Portland architect, David Giulietti, and the color schemes an interiors were designed by the celebrated Portland-based artist, Amee Erickson. 

But the best feature of this house is location. Across the street from Chapman School (with it's amazing annual Swift watch) and historic Wallace Park (where Bill Walton would play pick up basketball off-season), three blocks from the shopping and restaurants of 23rd Ave., excellent access to Forest Park, I-5, downtown, mass transit.

You know it when you feel it in your bones. I bought this gem to make it my home, but ended up not being able to move north from San Francisco.   I love this place, and will continue to treasure it from afar, and maybe you will make it yours too.

The contractor who completely gutted the property last year, upgraded every single thing to brand new, and expanded it, and did a really phenomenal job.  For starters, I love to cook, and he nailed the kitchen.  It's gorgeous with all Viking appliances, marble counter tops, and an awesome pantry.  The lighting gives it great style, and the layout draws you in so you just want to hang out. 

Off one side of the kitchen is a laundry room with big brand new LG super high-end washer and dryer set.  Off the laundry is a one-car garage with remote access, as well as keypad entry.

On the other side of the kitchen is open to the dining area - a feel good area that has a really cozy living room on the other side.  The living room has a gas fireplace on one wall, and sliding glass doors out the elevated deck on another.  The view from the living room and off the deck is all green with lots and lots of trees overlooking an open area.  

The master is off the living room and has lots of windows, a gorgeous bathroom, as well as a walk-in-closet.  The master bath has a separate shower and tub, and a commode in a private room.  It is all high end, and very tastefully finished.

The downstairs floor plan shows one big room as storage, but it would make a really cute bedroom.  Outside of that is a family room, which is quite cozy with big windows.  The other side of the downstairs is a really nice bathroom, super cute sitting area, and another bedroom.  Off the sitting area is a full on wine cave that can be used for just about anything because it is pretty big.  There is separate storage down there and some big closets.  There is also access to the back yard and walkway up the side of the house.

The area is close to a big, amazing hiking area that is pretty breathtaking in the fall.  On top of the hill, and not far from the house, is the OHSU health facility with a tram that goes straight down the hill ? crazy views too.  There is an awesome health/work-out facility with a salt-water lap pool at the bottom of the tram ride.  From there take whatever train you want to wherever in Portland; think easy access at the bottom, and total privacy at the top.

Hood in all of Portland. Named ‘Eagle Point’ for land’s historic role as a viewpoint where Native Americans gathered to honor the bald eagles that nest on Ross Island in the Willamette River below, this home has views that will never cease to impress.

Designed by architect Curt Olson, this light-filled home was completed in 1999 and includes three levels of living space. Enter the home on the ground floor into the living room with a wall of 14 ft. tall windows that perfectly showcase Mt. Hood. The views here at sunrise are absolutely spectacular - though mid-morning, noon, sunset and the incredible alpenglow are equally stunning. In fact, there isn’t a time of day or type of weather that isn’t beautifully showcased through these windows. The living room includes a smooth stone-fronted gas fireplace and skylight ensuring that even on the grayest days in Portland the space is filled with light. The adjacent kitchen has maple floors and cabinetry and a large granite island that seats at least four. A granite-topped bar with a small sink and one of the two dishwashers lines one side of the kitchen. The FiveStar stainless steel range and hood with 6 burners, Lodge Cast Iron griddle/ grill and side-by-side ovens is a cook’s dream. The huge window over the sink looks out to the same amazing view as the living room and includes an enormous sequoia tree. The refrigerator has the same maple front as the cabinets and a lit alcove above for display. The dining room is slightly detached from the kitchen allowing for more formality if the occasion requires.

Outside, a large deck on the ground floor is the perfect place for al fresco meals or to enjoy a glass of wine while taking in the view. The experience gets even better after traveling up a serial staircase where a rooftop deck provides an even wider panoramic view. On the opposite side of the foyer is the master suite. Set apart from the rest of the house this space provides its own private Mt. Hood view and deck. Enjoy the sunrise view without even getting out of bed! The large en suite includes a huge walk-in closet with a built in dresser and his and hers storage areas. For added convenience, full laundry facilities are also housed in the closet.


Though built on a hillside, this home has plenty of outdoor space. Many elements of the landscape design were created to be reminiscent of a traditional English estate. A lovely arched laburnum walkway is covered in wisteria, jasmine, passion flower and clematis in the late spring. It leads out to the meandering gravel paths of the garden where varieties of apple and pear trees can be found as well as blueberries and black and red currant bushes. One area of the garden boasts a large planting of bearded iris that is a beautiful mass of purple when in bloom. Rhododendrons, azaleas and lilacs are also scattered throughout the space. A raised bed for vegetables or flowers is irrigated, along with the entire outdoor space and decks and patios, by an automated system that also tracks rainfall and weather forecasts.
 The driveway, just off Terwilliger Road only minutes from OHSU and Doernbecher Children’s Hospital, is an unassuming entryway to such a spectacular property. Bordered on one side by land deeded to the City of Portland by the Nature Conservancy, this spot feels as though it   is tucked away by itself while it is only 10 minutes to downtown Portland. It’s a place where walking trails are across the street, restaurants are a quick drive and access to the I-5 corridor is just around the corner.
